# loop-detector
As the name implies, the purpose of loop detection is to find loops in the code. At the source level, keywords like while or for give you an easy way to spot loops. At the binary level, itâ€™s a little harder, because loops are implemented using the same (conditional or unconditional) jump instructions used to implement if/else branches and switches.
